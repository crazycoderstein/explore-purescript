## Module React.Explore

We can think of user interfaces as exploring a (pointed) space of states.
We can model that space using a comonad, and different choices of comonad
correspond to different UI patterns:

- Store corresponds to something like React, where we just have a state,
  and a function taking each state to a user interface.
- The Traced comonad corresponds to something like an incremental game,
  where we have a state for every value in some monoid.
- Mealy machines are more like the Elm architecture, where we respond to
  input events, and update some internal state.
- A cofree comonad is a bit like Halogen. We have some functor which
  describes the transitions to new states, but which can also respond
  to queries on the current state.

We can use `Co w` to explore the state space. `Co w` actions will be
connected to the user interface. For example:

- `Co (Store s)` is isomorphic to `State s`, so we can use get and put to
  read and write the stored state.
- `Co (Traced w)` is isomorphic to `Writer`, so we can use `tell` to append some monoidal
  value to our state.
- `Mealy action` is `Cofree (Function action)`, so `Co (Mealy action)` is isomorphic to
  `Free (Tuple action)`. We can emit zero or more actions in response to
  each user event.
- `Co (Cofree f)` is isomorphic to `Free g` whenever `f` pairs with `g`. This
  corresponds to something like the Halogen API.

#### `ReactEff`

``` purescript
type ReactEff state refs = (state :: ReactState state, props :: ReactProps, refs :: ReactRefs refs)
```

A handy type synonym for tidying up some type signatures.

#### `Handler`

``` purescript
type Handler a = a -> Eff (ReactEff ReadWrite ReadOnly) Unit
```

A `Handler` takes an action and modifies the React component state.

#### `UI`

``` purescript
type UI a = Handler a -> ReactElement
```

A UI, which is parameterized by its type of actions. For the purposes of
this implementation, a `UI` is just a `ReactElement` which takes its event
`Handler` as an explicit argument.

#### `Component`

``` purescript
type Component w = w (UI (Co w Unit))
```

A `Component` is a comonad `w` full of future `UI`s. Those `UI`s can dispatch
actions in the `Co w` monad in order to explore the state space.

#### `explore`

``` purescript
explore :: forall w props. Comonad w => Component w -> ReactClass props
```

Explore a space of states specified by some comonad, and defined by a
value in that comonad.

This function creates a `ReactClass` which can be rendered using React.
See the test project for an example.
